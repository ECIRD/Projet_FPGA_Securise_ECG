2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch F/associate_data_o_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin F/associate_data_o_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch F/data_valid_o_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin F/data_valid_o_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch F/en_cipher_reg_o_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin F/en_cipher_reg_o_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch F/en_cpt_o_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin F/en_cpt_o_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch F/finalisation_o_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin F/finalisation_o_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch F/init_cpt_o_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin F/init_cpt_o_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch F/init_o_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin F/init_o_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 7 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
